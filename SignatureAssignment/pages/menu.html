  <h2> Kacchi Biryani </h2>
  <center> <img src="../images/KachayBiryani1.png" alt= "Kacchi Biryani" width="600" height="500"></center>
  <p>Kacchi Biryani is one of Bangladeshi people’s most loved foods. It is so loved, it is served at most festivals and special occasions, such as weddings, picnics, etc. I love this dish. <br>
    <br>
    The most popular biryani in Bangladesh is Dhaka Kacchi Biryani. You will always find the Dhaka street biryani stall crowded because of the huge demand for this food. The main ingredients are rice and marinated meat cooked in lots of spices, giving it its special taste. The spices are nutmeg, mace, pepper, cloves, cardamom, cinnamon, bay leaves, coriander, mint, ginger, onion, tomatoes, green chilies, and garlic. It is sometimes served with a boiled egg and salad.<br>
    <br>
    This rich and flavorful dish is lip-smackingly good. A tip: take a half spoon of biryani and put it on your tongue without chewing it. You will feel the flavor spreading around your mouth. Everyone is happy with a plate of biryani, so you too should try this little bit of magic. </p>
  <h2> Panta Ilish</h2>

	<p>Panta Ilish is a traditional food that almost every Bangladeshi eats at the Pohela Boishakh Festival (the first day of Bangla year). It’s the most popular food in Bangladesh. We love this dish as it is a great symbol and celebration of our culture and tradition. <br>
  <br>
  	It’s a platter of leftover rice soaked in water and served with fried hilsa, achar, and dal. People eat Panta Ilish in the morning of Pohela Boishakh and then take part in cultural programs. The flavorful, crispy, and delicious hilsa fish served with water-soaked cold rice and spicy bharta presents a combination of salty and chili tastes. You will love it after your first mouthful. Another fish, American shad, tastes like hilsa, so you can buy that and have yourself some Bengali pleasure. </p>
	
<h2> Vuna Khichuri</h2>

	<p>Khichuri is a dish made of rice and lentils (dal). Vuna Khichuri (roasted) is cooked with different ingredients and spices from normal Khichuri. It’s served with roasted meat and pickle. It’s one of the tastiest and best loved foods in Bangladesh. Seasoned with a dash of turmeric and salt and topped with ghee, Khuchuri makes an ideal lunch or dinner. <br> <br>
	
	But you can make it tastier and more “gourmet” by adding veggies, dried fruit, and meat or chicken. It’s a comforting food for rainy days, and very popular at family get togethers.
	</p>

	<h2>Grill Chicken</h2>
 	<center><img src="../images/grillChicken1.png" alt= "Grill Chicken" width="600" height="500"> </center>
	<p>Almost every restaurant in Bangladesh serves this dish, and more than 50,000 grilled chickens are sold every day throughout the country. There are different ways of grilling chicken and there are many variations of spices that are used. Many restaurants roast chickens in a glass oven placed outside to entice people in to eat. It’s a very successful strategy. <br> <br>
	
	Now, it is mostly eaten with Naan Roti. Naan Roti is an oven-baked leavened flatbread—the perfect food with chicken. The bread is a little sweet while the chicken is spicy. This combination creates a fabulous wild taste in your mouth.</p>
	
	<h2> Rasgulla </h2>
 	<center> <img src="../images/rasgulla.png" alt= "Rasgulla" width="600" height="500"> </center>
	<p>Rasgulla or Roshogulla (syrup filled roll) is one of the most popular sweets in Bangladesh. It is traditionally eaten after lunch as the people of Bangladesh love to eat sweet dishes after a heavy meal. Sweet and spongy rasgulla is also served to guests and at festivals and special occasions.  <br> <br>
	
	Its origins are contested. Some believe Rasgulla originated in East India while others claim is was Bangladesh. It is made from ball-shaped dumplings of chhena and semolina, cooked in a light syrup. The syrup soaks into the dumplings, creating soft, fluffy, syrupy white-colored sweets that melt in the mouth. They can be eaten hot, cold or at room temperature: and each one tastes different. </p>
